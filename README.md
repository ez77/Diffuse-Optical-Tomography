# Diffuse-Optical-Tomography

This repository contains the simulation of a perturbation in an infinite homogeneous media. The recovery of the position of the perturbation in the media is 
done by the measurement of the photons arrived to an array of photodetectors. The project is made up of three phases that can be found in Jupyter Notebooks **Phase1.ipynb, 
Phase 2.ipynb** and **Phase 3.ipynb**. 

- Phase 1: consititutes the definition of the problem and its solution in the trivial case. 
- Phase 2: is the 3D case of Phase 1 in a more realistic physical scenario.
- Phase 3: is a realistic case where random Poisson noise is added to the data.
